 Bike Rental Demand Prediction :
 
(Flask-Powered ML Web App for Hourly Rental Forecasting)
A production-ready Machine Learning web application designed to forecast hourly bike rental demand using the UCI Bike Sharing Dataset. This project showcases advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and a sleek, responsive user interface built with HTML/CSS and integrated seamlessly via Flask.

Project Overview :

The Bike Rental Demand Prediction project leverages real-world historical bike rental data to build a robust ML pipeline that predicts hourly rental counts based on a variety of 
features such as .

Weather conditions

Temperature and humidity

Season, day, hour, and holiday info

Weekend vs. weekday behavior

Interaction between environmental and temporal variables

This application combines the power of data science, machine learning, and web development to deliver accurate, real-time predictions through a user-friendly interface.
